# Sales-Forecasting--using-Amazon-Reviews

At first we tried to extract amazon reviews for a "month" from the amazon website using technique like "web-scrapping" in python. Then we automated the reviews from the site so as to perform furthur analysis like sentiment analysis, tokenization, bag-of words, etc. And then created a weighted matrix so to predict the sales for upcoming month for that product.

Thank you!!!
