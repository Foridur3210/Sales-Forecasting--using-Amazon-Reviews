The only issue was the 'guide stickers' didn't stick very well. It is a good idea to provide the 'stickers' to make the process of aligning the screen protector easier, however when I would try and remove the 'protective layer' from the 'screen protector', the hinges kept peeling off. So, it ended up being just as frustrating as not having the 'guide stickers' at all.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Anyway, installing the screen protector was super easy (Disclosure: i have worked for a major wireless carrier for over 10 years so I have plenty of experience placing screen protectors on devices). The only thing I needed help with was placing the little tab stickers on the screen protector and around the back of the iPad to keep it in place. Once I removed the plastic film and flipped the protector over the screen of the iPad the protector pretty much stuck to the screen on its own and surprisingly left zero air bubbles. I bought this screen protector 3 separate occasions (I have 3 kids that definitely need these on their iPads) and i have had the same experience. It is not a “fluke” or “pure luck” that these screen protectors left zero bubbles upon installation. They seriously required zero effort from my part. I understand not everyone will probably have the same experience as mine, but honestly I believe it’s all due to user error. The screen protectors have offered amazing protection to my kids iPads and since they are 9, 7, and 1 you can imagine that they have been tested. Their iPads have been dropped, tossed, and thrown all over the house (okay mostly from the 1 year old, but the protector has lived up to its name. (Disclosure: It also helps having a sturdy case on the iPad).

In conclusion: installation was easy, protection has been excellent thus far, and seriously—it’s only $10. People spend more on one cup of coffee at Starbucks. :)","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

At first, I was highly disappointed with the quality of the product. I followed the instructions in the book it gave but the end result was terrible. I couldn't get the air bubbles out. I sent a review to the company and they immediately got in contact with me again. They said they would send a replacement with no charge. They also gave me a list of recommended videos on youtube to help install the protective glass. I used the videos that they gave me, and they end result was fantastic! The glass is so light and once it was properly on the screen it looked wonderful. I can't even till it has a screen protector! It works great with simple styles pen that I have, and the quality of the screen isn't degraded by the protector. I would buy this product again. Warning to new users that don't usually install protectors I highly recommend looking at the tutorial videos on youtube to install this product correctly the first time. I don't know if the first try was my error or the companies but I'm grateful for the replacement they sent me to try it again.

The install procedure worked well. Clean until your sure there’s nothing on the surface then clean a couple more times. One small speck of anything left on the screen will be very noticeable. The method used to align the protector worked very well. I had a couple of size-able air bubbles, patience working with the included plastic card got them out.

Most of them were fairly competent in their function but they all share one flaw. Putting a protective layer of any kind always seems takes away from the picture. Yes, even if its just clear, plastic just doesn't reflect the same way, just doesn't look as sharp to me as the original glass. Maybe I'm crazy but thats been my experience thus far. I accept that with a full surround case or a screen protector I will be sacrificing image quality, especially as the plastic protector ages. Having said all of this, this is the single best screen protector I have ever purchased. Easy to install, comes with literally everything you need to install it, and once its in place there is absolutely zero image quality difference whatsoever, like zero, the picture seriously looks exactly as it does without it on. I will be purchasing one of these for every device I own. I have not tried any of the other sellers versions of this style of screen protectors, so its possible they all look great. But, this is the one I chose and I am very happy with that decision.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It was very very quick to cling to the ipad as soon as I started to place it - it almost felt like a magnetic pull to the screen and it wasn't straight.  I had to lift it to re position it and again it clung quickly but straight this time and I noticed a small fingerprint on the backside of it but wasn't going to lift it again to retry.

SPARIN blows them all away. Not only was the installation practical and uncomplicated, once the glass melded to the screen, it all but vanished. Yes, you can see the edge... the button cutout is a hair bigger than the actual button... and the outer edge of the glass itself is also just a hair smaller than the surface of the device's face, not that it matters unless you have something that's 100% bezel-less. But other than this edge, the protector pretty much disappears. It feels like there's absolutely nothing between you and your screen.

Bottom line, from now on I will only buy SPARIN glass screen protectors. Even the price is fair. The packaging alone feels so premium you'll think you got a crazy discount on a high-end product. I bought these for both my wife's IPAD (6), and my Surface Pro 6. I will post this same review on both versions of the screen protector.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately this one doesn't live up to their reputation.
First, I have to say that I pride myself on being able to install these protectors perfectly, with no dust or bubbles. I know it sounds like hubris, but I do it for all of my friends and family members because of the results I'm able to get. It's a limited talent, but it's what I've got.
However, I cannot get the edges and the holes to line up with this screen protector. There is a noticeable ripple and curvature to the edges. It's simply not cut correctly. It's difficult enough to get right, due to the size of the thing, but because the cutouts don't line up it's impossible to have the edges aligned with the sides and the holes centered around the sensor and camera. If it was only slightly off it would be fine, but if I center the holes one edge hangs off just enough to not stick down. I finally got it close enough but the corners and parts of the edge don't adhere. It's not in the visible area, so I wasn't concerned, but over time the gaps are spreading farther into the screen area. It's slowly peeling itself off. Picture attached.
I contacted Sparin, and while they agreed to send a replacement, their attitude was that my installation was clearly at fault. They made it clear that they did not consider this a warranty issue. They said they would, out of the goodness of their hearts, give me ONE MORE to try again. There is not one spec of dust under it, and it is lined up with the sides as perfectly as I could get it.
I will try the replacement in the hope that this was a rare factory defect, but based on the poor quality control, and the attitude of their customer service, if it doesn't work I won't buy another one from Sparin. I've deducted a star for each issue.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I have had many phones and electronics over the past 15 or so years and applying a screen protector is something I dreaded doing because they never came put just right. This was super easy and came out perfect the first time!

Works fine with your fingers ... Haven't tried the pencil yet.

Installation is a little tricky... I tried to use the hinge method in the directions but the sticky paper wasn't sticky enough and they came loose, so I just placed the screen down using the edges to hold onto and slowly put it into place... It was on right but it had bubbles... I tried to move the bubbles from the center to the edges without much success, so I tried something different... I picked up the left side from the edge using a fingernail at the top and bottom and raised it up enough to create a gap to the middle of the screen and then let the screen protector back down slowly and all the bubbles disappeared.  Did the same thing on the right side with similar results.  Doing it like this doesn't change the alignment of the screen on the iPad since half is still sticking while the other half is relaid from the center out eliminating the bubbles.

Packaging, supplies, product quality ... all first rate.

The ipad was sitting on my desk, after half an hour I go and pick up a pen that rolled on the floor, the cord got stuck in the arm rest of my chair and when I turned the chair it yanked the ipad off the desk and it went screen first into the floor and made noise even with headphones on.  My heart sank the second I heard the noise, I pick it up and the first thing I notice are 3 big cracks.  I couldnt tell if it was the protector only or the screen too.  I slowly peeled the protector off and to my relief the screen was in the exact condition as it was when I put the protector on. I figured over time this protector would eventually get a scratch or two if I'm not lucky.  I've put these protectors on all my phones and never once did a drop from a few feet or sometimes even further leave any marks really.  This ipad I bought was only a few weeks old and without this protector I would be spending hundreds on a new screen.

The first thing I did after taking off the cracked protector was to come back here and order another one.  Until it arrives I'm keeping my ipad put away because I really dont want to take the chance of dropping it again on accident.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The problem I have is with the installation instructions and how brittle the glass is.  The instructions included were not made for iPad screen protectors, but instead were for iPhone protectors.  The assumption was there is no difference, but there is a little difference.. still, it shows the company wanted to save a few bucks by just re-using the iPhone instructions.  Second, instructions do not explain in English which side of the screen is ""up"" when it instructs you to tape anchor it down.  After anchoring it down I discovered I had the wrong side up and when trying to remove and replace the anchor tape, the screen cracked.  This leads me to believe that the screen is very delicate and would probably crack very easily after installed.

Unfortunately, when I applied the glass  onto my iPad there was one little bubble on the side of the screen. I cannot get rid of it, but I attribute that to my own error. The screen protector is better at resisting oil and fingerprints than the iPads screen  which is a huge plus for me because I like my screen clean.

One installation tip: be sure, when pulling the adhesive off the glass (using the handy pull tab), not to let the glass torque and pull of the hinge tape.

That's happened to us maybe unfortunately twice since owning iPads. The glass case is what broke on us, not the actual iPad which is the purpose of these cases.  Recently my son dropped our iPad and the screen completely shattered.  At first I thought it wasn't a big deal, it was just the protector screen, we could peel it off and the iPad should be fine right? That's what happened in the past... well, Not this time.  Our iPad was completely shattered and the screen was not tempered glass as it said it was.  It was plastic.  It peeled right off, and went right back on over the shattered glass.  When the iPad fell typically the tempered glass case is what breaks.  It shouldn't be able to peel off and go back on.  It should be broken and unusable once taken off. Because it's happened in the past and our iPad was perfectly fine, but the protector case was cracked.  The fact that I thought our iPad was protected this entire time, and now my iPad is shattered because we really had a plastic case on it and not glass is what really upsets me. We have never had our iPad shatter using a tempered glass protector screen.  So this clearly is not tempered glass. Next time I will buy my screen at the store and make sure it is a real protector screen.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had no trouble actually putting it on and I didn’t need all of the extras for help. My issue is that I have lots of pets so flying pet hair IS a huge problem for me. So I had to do some prep work before attempting this. I cleaned my smallest bathroom and turned it into an actual “clean room”. I turned the exhaust fan off and central heat off so NOTHING would be flying around. I put on a full clean room suit, covered my hair and shoes. JUST KIDDING😹, but I did change my clothes so they were fur-free! Then I started the procedure: I cleaned the screen with their clean and dry wipes, then applied the protector as instructed. MOST IMPORTANT PART IS LINING IT UP! You really only get one shot because it will crack if you try to move it so make sure you are on target. Luckily I nailed it the first time and it went right on perfect! There was not a bubble, speck of dirt, or cat/dog fur to be found under the screen! I used the squeegee card to make sure it was completely affixed and VOILA! It is perfect. So most of you will not go to my silly extreme measures, but I have gone thru these things like qtips because of just haphazardly throwing them on. So it was worth the prep time to ensure this one did not end up in the trash. It is shiny and sooo strong and yet all of my touches and stylus work great with no issues. Hope it lasts and I don’t have to go thru this for a long time! Good luck. Let me know if this helpful to anyone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

I accidentally kneed my iPad to the corner of my bedside table (true story) and the tempered glass did what it was supposed to do - protect the device underneath.  The top middle part of the screen protector was scratched and cracked (I made it worse by pulling it up to see if the actual iPad glass was broken - it had not, thank goodness!) and am happily ordering a second one as this is much easier to replace than to repair my device.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_37?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=37&reviewerType=all_reviews"

On my first try to install it I ruined it. The stickers that are supposed to keep it in the original position before you take off the sticky side protector weren't fastened properly and they came off. As a result it wasn't positioned correctly and when I tried to fix it, it got ruined. Once you touch the inner (sticky) side it's done - can't be cleaned and can't be re-fitted. Following my complaint the company sent me a new one, and I was able to install it properly.
I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised by the customer service, kudos on that!

The protector is very clear and seems very strong. Really the only down side is that the installation step is delicate with an iPad. You should do it extremely carefully because you only got one shot. Watch the provided YouTube, and fasten those stickers well...","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The cover is very firm so even if you are clumsy like me it's east to line up with iPad and place! Rubber or microfiber stylus work great!

I had iPads, and iPhones which by accident fell from a high place... it is not because you're not careful, accidents happen and it is hard to predict the next... my experience with devices falling by accident, is that with a protect-screen, glass will be more resistant to cracks, so in the unlike event it would accidentally fall, no more crack right across the device... I once went to Apple to replace the damaged screen of an iPhone 6, and it costed nearly$100...

Also, unlike my other screen protections, which resulted in bubbles as you applied, no matter how careful i was, this one had a video that includes creating a hinge, wiping with wet wipe, then drywipe, then remove dust, and finally sticking the sticker, and voi-la! no air-bubbles, just perfect!

No matter how closely I followed the instructions, I was always left with permanent bubbles under the screen protector, or worse, trapped dust particles.  After spending a large chunk of money for my Apple iPad I knew I would need to install a screen protector to protect my investment.  Of course, based on past experiences I dreaded the whole process.  So after searching for a suitable screen protector on Amazon and reading the reviews, I settled on this one from SPARIN.  Once it arrived, I watched the recommended installation video on YouTube.  In fact, I watched it during the install as well, pausing the video as I completed each step.  To my amazement, the screen protector was quite simple to install, and it turned out perfectly.  No trapped dust, no bubbles, just a sleek, shiny awesome looking screen protector.  This particular glass screen protector does not affect the sensitivity of the touchscreen at all, unlike some I have used in the past.  To sum it all up, this is a high-quality product which was very easy to install.  It looks and feels great on my iPad.  Best of all, I installed it myself without any hassles.  Definitely will purchase from SPARIN for my future screen protector needs.

Update: these folks are big on customer service! Very soon after I posted my above annoyance, I was contacted by customer service who made sure I promptly got another screen protector at no cost.  I haven't put in on yet, will save it for when I absolutely need it. For now, the holey bubbly screen protector is keeping my iPad well protected from scratches and free of fingerprints and other smudges, which was the main goal.

Davis","Installation is not as easy and instructions suggest.","November 17, 2016","Nice idea for installation - doesn't exactly work they way they describe.

I thought the idea with the ""hinges"" was a good idea. However, when I lifted the screen protector up on the hinges to remove the backing - the hinges promptly fell off of the screen protector. So I just eyeballed it and placed it on the screen.

Second - there needs to be some sort of card to help push out bubbles. The directions state that once the protector is affixed to the screen - you just slide your finger up and down along the iPad screen and it will ""automatically attach"" to the screen. Not exactly. I spent several minutes trying to work out the bubbles - and the screen protector is so thick, that I had to exert a lot of pressure to force the bubbles towards the edge - and I was worried about how much pressure I was putting on my new iPad screen.

If I had realized this screen protector was so thick - I probably wouldn't have purchased it. I'm more concerned about protecting from smudges and small scratches - I don't need something this thick.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The screen cleanser takes away all the oils and dirt from the iPad screen. The lint-free dry wipe cloth wipes off the iPad screen sparkling clean without leaving dust. When applying the glass screen protector, the installation package comes with a ""dust collector"" (a light adhesive) that you can use to take off unexpected dust and lint in the air that attaches to the application face of the glass screen protector and iPad screen. This will prevent the irritating and frustrating ""bubbles"" that these particles can cause. The outcome results appears as if no screen protector is on... shear clarity if directions are followed and you remove any particles on the iPad screen and screen protector application face.

I had a brand new iPad, literally just took the factory packaging off. Not even a smudge.

So I gently lifted it to straighten. When lifting it, dust and dirt attached the underside of the protector (not the screen, screen was spotless still) Couldn't remove dirt from sticky side of protector, so now I have flecks ALL OVER the screen.

I am taking off a star because of the air bubbles that remain. It is not such a big deal, but I think it should be easier to place this on without getting the air bubbles left behind. I tried several times to put it on and off. Maybe I have bad technique and others have had better luck with the air bubbles.

It is a glass sheet not plastic so it looks like you don't even have a screen protector on. The packaging was incredible, it was a hard cardboard book with a foam insert and the screen was wrapped carefully inside. It had the cleaning supplies with it. Everything needed for installation was there. This is by far the best screen protector I have ever had and I have used a bunch of them. Also the screen protector doesn't fingerprint and smudge like the unprotected screen does. You tap on the little hinges and when you drop the screen down it just sucks itself on and pushes the air out with no bubbles the first try. No re-positioning needed.

It's smooth, doesn't effect the sensitivity of screen, and of corse there will be bubbles that can not be smoothed out over shatters. There were no bubbles where they hairline cracks were. I found it easier to Google video instructions and then the directions made more sense. Step one only says to place hinge stickers on back, I put them on wrong before watching a video. I didn't leave quite enough length to fold over the top of the screen to hold the protector. So when I removed the stickers to replace them they were not as sticky. Make sure you do this on a flat surface so there is enough room for the protector to lay beside the iPad or the stickers will start peeling off the protector, which probably would not have happened if I didn't have to replace he stickers.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I don’t usually use one on my phone, because they are hard to install getting them lined right without any dust underneath.
  I decided to try this one for our new iPad since the kids will be using it a lot. This was super easy to install and it is crystal clear. With a case on there also you can’t even tell that there is even a screen protector on the iPad. I was wondering about if it would be too thick, but the case fit just fine with it on there.
  The touch sensitivity seems to work perfectly with it installed.
  The process they give you to install it works great if you follow the directions to the letter.
  I can’t comment fully on the durability yet but it should be fine. Better than not using one.
  I would recommend this brand 100%. I’m thinking of ordering one for my iPhone.
EDIT: I just ordered a second one of these. This was amazing. One of my children pushed the other while they were holding the iPad. They fell and elbow dropped the screen.

Much better price than the ones I looked at in stores, sturdy packaging, and reasonably easy to apply following the diagram-based instructions.

1) Let the bottom part of the screen protector touch Ipad's bottom part of the screen edge
2) Align the home button circle with the screen protector hole
3) While still lifting the top two corners, try to align top corners
4) Gradually lower down the top corners which are being hold by two hands
5) If it doesn't fit the corner, lift your hands to re-position gently. It is very easy to come out.
6) If every corners are aligned properly let go of the two top corners
7) While you are letting go of the two corners, you will see air escaping from the protector. This is the most enjoyable moment :)
Good Luck!!!
Note: The above procedure was done on a brand new, out of box unit. Cleaning before installing is important. So make sure the surface is free from lints and grease.

To start, the product comes in a fantastic package with everything you will need to get the job done! Inside the package is a little instructional manual that gives you the link to the YouTube video for those of you like me and aren’t very good at placing screens. The video was literally step by step simple and easy steps that left me feeling confident I wouldn’t jack this up. I followed the video exactly and I have to be honest, this is one of the best proctective screens on any of my devices. It installed so easily and so perfect. No lint, dust, or air bubbles. You can’t even tell it’s there!! I would highly recommend this product to anyone considering buying it, and am also going to buy more for my other devices!!

I thought it would drive me nuts, but the adhesive closed around the dust particle so that unless I'm actively looking for it, it's unnoticeable. Reading the experiences of other users also convinced me that trying to remove the particle would be worse than just leaving it alone. Screen has a great feel to it and is nearly as sensitive to touch as the unprotected screen. Color me satisfied.

By the time I got to step 5 or so, I realized that what I did earlier (removed the protective film) was a mistake.  Therefore, I got dust, etc. between the new protective screen and my iPad.  Even the smallest mote of dust causes a bubble where the protective screen does not adhere properly.  I screwed around for 10-15 minutes until I got passable results.  Was I to blame?  Partly, but the instruction could definitely be better. Or I should have read through all the instructions before I started.  Also, I'm not sure what I expected, but this screen protector is labeled ""tempered glass"".  It's a piece of plastic--like other screen protectors I've purchased.

Nothing too great or too bad.  While obviously you have to be very careful with dust, the only other practical advice I have is to use all three stickers as a hinge because two stickers alone are not sticky enough to keep hold of the protector when you are peeling off the film.  Peel even a little too fast and the ""sticker hinge"" will let go of the protector.  I haven't had it long enough to judge the actual efficacy of the glass protector itself.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Comes with cleaning products before application. iPad looks great as ever.","February 22, 2017","Great product! The tempered glass covers the entire front of the iPad, but it does not look intrusive. In fact, if it's applied correctly, the protective cover seamlessly integrates well with the product.

I love how the product comes with a wet wipe, dry wipe, microfiber cloth and a dust remover. Using them in that order ensures that your original screen is clean, and the screen protector will look 100% transparent after application.

The product came with some ""GuideStickers"" to help you make a hinge and apply the protective screen easier. I found this not to be very helpful as the stickers kept coming off. I ended up grabbing the screen on its side, without touching the side that contacts with the iPad screen, and applied it manually.

Some negative reviews claim that they have unremovable bubbles after applying the cover. I think this is careless application on their part. If you are careful, you can ensure that there are no bubbles after application. The best way to prevent any potential bubbles is to make sure that the protective screen is placed starting from one edge and finishing of to another edge. I found that bending the protective screen ensured this edge-to-edge placement. In essence, you want to displace all of the air so that there is no gap between your iPad screen and the protective glass cover.

See the attached picture to see how it looks if done properly! The protective screen certainly looks like it's meant to be part of the iPad and I don't see any visual change in terms of viewing quality.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

A few days after I posted a 3-star review complaining about an apparent quality control issue (particulate matter stuck to underside of the protector *inside* the protective sheet), I received a direct email from a company representative apologizing for the problem and offering a free replacement. I was very busy & didn't respond to the email at first, so I received a 2nd email with the same offer a couple of days later. I emailed back, verified my shipping address, and a few days later a new package was on my front porch. I waited overnight for it to warm up to room temperature, removed the defective protector from the iPad, and installed the new protector after very, VERY carefully inspecting it and using the installation kit to clean the iPad's screen. There were no adhesion problems, very few bubbles (all of which were easily cleared in a matter of moments), and only one tiny imperfection that is literally invisible without a magnifying glass and a careful search. I am very pleased with the replacement product and happily shocked at the exemplary customer service. (To repeat, the company contacted me with an apology & no-strings-attached replacement before I had the chance to contact them.) As of now, I'll definitely buy from them again as needed in the future.

One quick note: As mentioned in my original review, there are stick-on tabs to create a ""hinge"" to help position the screen protector prior to installation. This time around I did not use them and found it easier to carefully position the screen protector the old-fashioned way. If you buy this product I recommend practice fitting the protector (BEFORE removing the film covering the adhesive!) with the hinges so you can tell if it would be easier for you to place it correctly with or without them -- I'm sure the choice will vary among buyers.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've used tempered glass screen protectors on a variety of devices, and the reviews of this one led to high expectations. I was amazed at how well-packaged it is: a semi-rigid heavy cardboard ""book"" style folder, with a separate ""installation kit"" inside along with the screen protector itself in a protective sleeve and an internal frame keeping everything in place & protected.

Unlike my experience with several other similar (smaller) protectors of other brands, the installation kit was complete and -- hooray! -- the ""wet"" wipe was actually wet. (Be careful opening the installation kit; I accidentally tore off a small part of the instruction booklet.) The first thing I noticed was more complete/complex instructions than I'd expected, along with a note saying I should view an instructional video on YouTube. The video came up right where it was supposed to be, but I immediately noticed that it skipped over 1 step in the printed directions (use the dry wipe after the wet wipe but before the microfiber cloth), and did not show or mention the stiff card (size of a credit card) intended to help move bubbles out from under the screen protector as the final installation step.

One very helpful feature of the installation kit was ""hinge"" stickers that let you pre-position the protector and then swing it out of the way to thoroughly clean the iPad screen, then just swing it back into place for installation already in the correct position... at least in theory. I still had to be very careful positioning the protector because the stickers still allow a bit more side-to-side wiggle than is perhaps absolutely necessary. It was when the protector was in place and beginning to adhere to the iPad screen when things went a bit sour.

Before using the installation kit, I had buffed the iPad with a clean microfiber cloth until it shined. I then used the installation kit's wet wipe, making sure to cover every tiny bit of the surface, followed by careful wiping with the kit's dry wipe. I then buffed the iPad with the microfiber cloth from the installation kit, followed by the included ""dust absorber"" (a big sticker you lightly tap all over the screen to pull off any dust particles that somehow were missed in all the preceding steps). At every step, I carefully inspected the iPad for dust, fingerprints, and any other kind of marking, checking it at multiple angles in direct & indirect lighting. (I can be a little obsessive when it comes to screen protectors.) I checked the screen protector one more time at different angles, and saw a few little spots I decided were probably dirt on the protective film. I then peeled the protective film off the back of the screen protector, swung it down onto the iPad, and began pressing out a few bubbles...

...only to find 7-8 bits of kind of particulate matter causing permanent bubbles scattered across the screen (not to mention the entire upper left 1/8 of the screen protector not sticking nearly as well as the rest of it). I peeled the protector back, did some more cleaning, reapplied the protector, and had the same particles in the same spots. I then very gently used the ""dust absorber"" directly on the sticky side of the screen protector and reapplied it for a second time, and was rewarded with just a few small bubbles I was able to manipulate out.

As of now, the upper left 1/8 of the screen protector seems to be sitting on the iPad screen and not actually adhering to it (that's 1 star off), and I'm a bit annoyed at how I had to clean particulate matter off the supposedly clean & protected *sticky* side of the screen protector (that's the 2nd star off). For the moment it seems to be staying in place & remaining clean, but I'll have to think twice about another of the same brand in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

My looking at many of these available I confused this product for the version that fits original iPad 2, and not the 9.7”. Totally my mistake, so I asked Amazon for the return information and found that after charges the credit was about a 1/5 of purchase price. Not worth the gas to get there. I decided to place it on Craigslist for $5.00, to end up making it free to anyone. My mistake so my review mentioned all you have read. Then a few days later I get an email from The Sparin customer service representative, asking about my review, and that policy related to returns makes it difficult to do. We emailed each other a couple times. To my amazement the Sparin customer service staff processed a full refund. One of my biggest pet peeve is poor customer service, but fear not, Sparin provides the hishest of standards to make sure their customers are satisfied.

Solid product.","April 2, 2018","Updated review.  After contacting support regarding the issues I had, I received a prompt response and a replacement product.  This installation went much better, with no stray red fibers. The replacement product also doesn’t seem to have the same attraction to all things dust.

I am changing my rating based on the my revised experience.  Customer service was courteous and prompt.

Because of my initial experience, I am holding back the fifth star.

My original review is below.
———————————————————————-

This appears to be a nice, high quality protector.

Unfortunately the installation is not as they say.

It bubbles, the corners lift, and strange red fibers appeared on the protector itself.

I may have had a bad one.

I did attempt the recommended relift/replace procedure, however the protector attracts dust ( electrostatic ? ) and both sides of the protector became coated with dust.

It does seem to attract dust to the surface, which isn’t helpful.

Unfortunately I cannot rate the durability, as the product was not able to be properly installed.

The last thing I want is a perpetually obscured screen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_23?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=23&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The vendor immediately contacted me and sent a replacement.  Since they went to that much trouble, I tried the product again. The installation kit has 3 items in it and the instructions only talked about two of them.  The words used in the instructions don't match what the labels have on the items.  I realized that when the instructions talk about the ""microfiber cloth"" it's actually the ""DRY WIPE"" they are referring to.  When you use the stickers to place the item USE ALL THREE.  This makes it much more stable.  I did NOT use the DUST thing the second time and things went much smoother.  You might have to use it if your device is not brand new.  Thankfully mine was new.

You either get unsightly bubbles from dust specks (no matter how much you wipe), or the positioning is off (no matter how much you line it up) - and while you are adjusting it, the underside is attracting dust like there is no tomorrow!

Which is why THIS screen protector is head and shoulders above the rest. It came in the pictured light yellow cardstock folio (kind of like an iPad case)- not necessary but A+ for presentation. It also had a ton of accessories including positioning stickers (no more readjusting!), 3 different kinds of wipes (wet, dry, and microfiber), and a dust removing sticker. The tempered glass itself looks and feels exactly like your shiny new iPad screen so you're not sacrificing visual or tactile sophistication for the sake of protection. And the best part is it's self-adhering - just lightly touch it to your (perfectly clean) screen and watch it work! Barely any extra squeezing or pressing is needed. I followed the instructions exactly and ended up with only one tiny bubble which I pressed out easily, which NEVER happens. I can't recommend this product enough!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

They will replace and they tracked me down to tell me so too.

I just placed the new protector they sent without using the hinges. I worked well. I had no problems this time and no bubbles or dust.

The “hinges” kept coming off of the screen protector top. The last time it happened, I had just removed the backing.  I ended up with dust specks and bubbles that were very difficult to remove. It was all messed up by then and I ended up just trashing the thing.  I’ve done plenty of these before. The hinge gimmick looked like it would make things easier but it did not. I should have done without the guides. Would have been much easier.  I’ll stick with the ones I know work well even though a couple dollars more. The reviews on this led me astray this time. I even used the video. These things really aren’t difficult if you follow directions but the “hinges” caused a lot of scrambling for a good hold when they kept falling off.

I’ve applied it this afternoon, and after hours of inspecting it, and testing it out it proves to be a great protector. Everything is literally crystal clear, and it looks as if nothing is applied at all. It has a very nice feel to it. My finger feels very comfortable gliding across the glass. It arrived in a book like premium case so it wouldn’t get damaged during shipping and handling which is very great. It also came with clear and easy instructions on how to install it on your iPad. The only thing is that the guidelines didn’t help me all that well, so I chose to install it without it. Now it worked for me because I’m used to installing tempered glass on phones so I know how to install them without additional help, but I’m not trying to discredit their use. They just weren’t for me. My installation came out fine, and I’m happy. Unfortunately after examining it I somehow got a teeny, tiny black spec of debris on the bottom left corner of my iPad, but that was my fault as I was rushing. You’re going to experience bubbles as that’s something that generally happens with all protected but a good firm push right after you apply the protector, and they’ll smooth right out.

I tried this product to replace my old screen protector of a different brand.

This screen protector has way too much glare. It's very hard to draw with mirror like reflections on the screen. Perhaps it would work in a dark room -- but as the purpose of an iPad is to be mobile, that would be rediculous.

Additionally, and I really don't know how or what this happens. The automatic screen brightness adjust feature doesn't seem to be working. For those unfamiliar, the iPad Pro has an amazing feature where is senses the lighting brightness and color of the room and automatically adjusts the iPad to deliver a consistent screen brightness no matter the setting. The screen I am currently writing this review on is quite dark. This is very frustrating.

I'm sure the screen protector must have some virtues in strength, but 2 strikes against it have caused me to order a different screen protector to replace this one.

I do not think this is a good choice for the iPad Pro.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It does it's job. I've used it with two different cases and it didn't come off or lift. The two iPad Pro cases I used it with were a Logitech case and NewTrent Airbender. For the record, I kept the NewTrent because it was much better and more secure.

Anyway, the screen protector is easy to instal. I never use the ""hinge"" technique they tell you to use when installing it. I just lined it up using the cut-out for Home button/bottom edge and slowly lowered it onto the screen; readjusting it slightly as I lowered it. Works every time for me.

So why 4 stars? the claim that it's coated in an oligophobic layer (for smudge resistance) only lasted MAYBE half a day. But that's typical for almost all the screen protectors out there. By the next day, you could see every smudge made. Still, I'd recommend this screen protector to anyone who wants to buy one.

UPDATED: Great customer service repping a solid product!","September 6, 2018","UPDATE: I’ve upped my review to the full 5 stars after receiving a response from customer service—unsolicited—apologizing for the bubbling issue despite adhering like a sensei’s acolyte to the installation process. A replacement product was mailed—also unsolicited—and Alisa, the customer service rep, could not have been more helpful and apologetic. I appreciate that the retailer wasn’t full of mere words but actions backing its product, and to substantiate its confidence, the second screen protector was installed without incident. I admit it seemed like there again might persist some pockets of air but within a couple of minutes they had all adhered. I’ll attach an updated pic soon of the glossy screen.

In all, I’m pleased with it. Yeah, it took some hassle I didn’t seek, but the customer service made up for it. The product works well. I’d purchase again, and I’d completely recommend the product and retailer to others.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Bubbled in the middle of the screen. See pic. And I had prepped w/ the focus of a neurosurgeon scrubbing in for a craniotomy. I watched the YouTube instructional video thrice (thrice!), reviewed the instructional booklet, prepped my area and iPad, and dug into application. Followed everything precisely as guided. Went well, until it the cruel final.

And the guidance is good, if sometimes lengthy. There are many steps: dry fit the protector w/ the guidance sticker [advice:
APPLY STICKERS FIRMLY b/c they will def slip destroying your handiwork at the final], wet cleaning, dry cleaning, dusting up w/ sticker (a nice feature), and application. The application is nice w/ a quick suction followed by a little bit (theoretically) of ironing out of bubbles.

But my bubble—obtrusive, frustrating, distracting—betrays the point of the product.

Product may otherwise be nice. I can only stare at this diabolical bubble whenever my eye spies the screen and hope it’s sweetly, surely asphyxiated.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I wouldn't take this screen protector off because I could feel the cracked glass underneath and the protector held it together well. Instead, I took my iPad up to Apple because it's still under warranty. That's when I discovered that my iPad screen was NOT cracked in fact, it was the screen protector that had cracked like glass. Amazing to see this come off and find my pad completely unscathed underneath.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_31?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=31&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was comparing it to more and a lot more expensive screen protectors and debating with myself which to buy.  I decided to give this one a chance, based on other reviews.

I am using the screen protector with Targus Versavu Rotating 9.7 inch case for iPad (model THZ63403GL-52).  Both fit PERFECTLY and have a very high quality feel.  When scrolling, the finger glides over the protector in the same way it would if it were not there.

The installation was a breeze and I do not quite understand those who complain the installation is difficult. SPARIN provided a Youtube video, however, I would suggest the following approach that is slightly different.

1. Instead of hinging the screen on the short side of the iPad, hinge it on the long side using all three stickers that are provided.
2. Once you finally peel off the film and lay the screen carefully down on the iPad, DO NOT swipe your finger across the iPad, as shown in the video. That will very likely create bubbles, just like it did in the video. Instead, just put your index finger in the center of the screen and watch the magic do its work.

I am very happy with this purchase.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros:
comes in a hard package, so it will not shatter for shipping. It almost feels like wood. I previiusly ordered ome that was in plastic, and it came completely shattered.
Perfect fit
Comes with lots of things to help install( shown in pictures)
Smooth edges
Cons:
No camera cut out, so it is hard to line up, but if you get it right, than it is perfect
Guide stickers are nit stick and screen pritevtor will fall of of them( so dont use them)

However, that's the problem.

Installation involves positioning the protector on the screen, and using stickers to create a sort of temporary hinge.  Once you've done that, there is a provided wet wipe to clean the screen, and a microfiber cloth to remove excess cleaner and fingerprints.  Next, the protective film must be removed from the glass, and here is where the problem lies.

Unless you have an ISO-9001 certified clean room at your disposal, I'm not sure how you can install this screen protector without getting any dust under it.  Removing the protective film creates such a buildup of static electricity that I could feel it, hear it, and even smell it.  It attracted dust out of the air, and by the time I got the glass onto my device and pressed down, the dust was sealed in.  It might not have been so bad, except that it creates a bubble around it where the glass is not in contact with the device, and it's very obvious, even for a small piece of dirt.

I removed the glass from the device, and attempted to remove the offending debris, but only succeeded in making the problem worse.  It quickly became apparent that I was not going to be able to use this screen protector.  I was very hopeful for a product that got so many positive reviews, but I am now disappointed.

Two stars, because as I said, if you can manage to get it installed without dust, it probably works just fine.  Good luck.

UPDATE: I was contacted by Sparin regarding my review above, and they offered to provide me with a free replacement.  We had a bit of email difficulty, but kudos for excellent customer service.  I received the replacement today, and I just happened to have a room in my house where I had just remodeled, so it was clean, clean, clean.  I applied the screen protector there, using the no stickers method (search YouTube for ""SPARIN A02""), which I would highly recommend.  This time, I got the screen protector installed on my iPad with no dust and only minor bubbles, which I was able to work out.  As I predicted above, once the screen protector is applied with no dust, dirt, or bubbles under it, it looks fine.  It feels smooth to the touch, as you'd expect for glass, and it doesn't add much in the way of thickness.  My case still fit around my iPad with no issues.  It seems to be pretty scratch resistant.  As for shattering, only time will tell (or hopefully, it won't!).

I'm updating my rating from 2 stars to 4, based on the customer service, and the apparent quality of the product (once you get it installed properly).","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It was the easiest experience I’ve ever had with putting these types of things on devices. I didn’t believe it when it said it doesn’t bubble, but it’s true*! (*you have to be sure to clean the screen well, and make sure not dust particles make their way to the edges as the screen is setting in). I don’t know why other screen protectors don’t include “guidance stickers” which basically allows you to create hinges so jar way you can position the screen properly and not just hope that it falls into the correct place. The kit comes with cleaning wipes (both wet and dry), a cleaning cloth, a little card to help the protector settle on to the screen, and even a sticker to help take any remaining dust particles before you place the protector.

This was definitely the best option for the price and I’m completely satisfied with my experience.

To be fair, that was largely user error on my part. After I posted that review, the company reached out to me and sent out a replacement, which I had much less of a problem applying to my iPad.

Just make sure to follow all of the instructions; my first time around I had skipped a step or two and assumed my iPad was clean enough, just to find a bunch of little dust particles all over it. With the replacement I followed all of the instructions, but still ended up with a small piece of fluff and what appears to be a fingerprint, but these are way easier to look past than all of the dust that appeared on the first try.

The install was extremely easy! For anyone who has ever installed a screen, we all know what a pain it can be.

It comes with a unique install plan that has you create a hinge. I added my own addition which was a 3rd tab on the opposite side of the hinge to swing the screen protector.

The only “con” was the cut of the material. I wish it had been cut to fit the thumb hole and the camera like my last screen protector.

Tons of bubbles resulted. Giving it two stars because it did seem like it would have fit beautifully and it was packaged well. Overall, disappointed.

UPDATE: Sparin contacted me immediately after my review and offered to send me another screen protector free of charge with some suggestions of how to change my method. Basically I did not use the guide stickers this time (peeled back half, aligned, pulled back other half, then ran my finger down the middle to allow it to adhere). This method worked MUCH better. I suggest doing this, or if you really want to use the hinge method to use additional tape and not the guide stickers provided. Great customer service though!

-Extremely easy to install
-dust stickers were very helpful when removing pet hairs and dust
-feels better than the iPad screen itself

Cons:
-was a hard to push the bubbles out but it was much easier to just lift the screen and continually push the air out to prevent bubbles from forming
-because the protector goes to the outer edges of the screen, my case wasnt made for that extra height and pushes the screen up creating air pockets at the corners (as seen in the picture).
-perhaps a little too smooth (due to oleophobic coating) making it a bit harder to control the apple pencil when drawing
-finger prints only appear when my fingers are slightly moist (can only be seem when the screen is off) but disappears completely with a wipe of my sleeve so fingerprints are hardly an issue

The tempered glass screen protector comes packaged in what almost looks like a book; it's a hard cardboard case that opens just like a book and protects the heck out of the product, A hard squishy rubber barrier further encases the screen protector within; then it's even wrapped up in more protection like a poly envelope that you can just slide it out of. I followed the manufacturers advice and watched the YouTube video on installation (search for SPARIN A09) and I felt confident enough I could do it.

Great value.","February 5, 2017","The product is encased in a sturdy, padded box. The instructions for installation are thorough, and everything you need for a great install is inside the box.the entire process took less than 3 minutes. It would have been much faster, but I am a perfectionist when it comes to placement. They actually have guide tab stickers to help you set the product into place before removing the film from the glass, which allows you to make certain the placement is perfect. Once, pressed into place, air bubbles are easily smoothed out. The finished install looks amazing, and since it is glass, it provides a great feel, unlike the rubbery plastic ones.

I purchased one of these for my daughter's new smartphone, and after having such a fantastic experience with it, I bought one for every electronic device in my house. I am absolutely astonished by the quality of this product, not to mention the amazing price point.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Installation was a bit difficult -- but if you read the directions and follow them it totally works.  Allow for some time to do all of the cleaning and adjusting to make it fit right.

But the reason for the positive review is that it totally saved my iPad -- I was using the ipad (I keep the stats for our school baseball team on it) and bumped into someone causing the ipad to fall 3-4 feet glass down onto a concrete floor.  I was certain the screen was destroyed and I'd need to replace the screen or buy a whole new iPad.  The screen protector was shattered completely -- but the screen underneath was 100% fine.  I was stunned (in a happy way) and this product easily saved me a new iPad.

Toughest part of application. UPDATE: Their service deserves your business.","April 22, 2018","Update to my review this weekend. They have already reached out to me and offered a replacement due to MY being unable to align the screen after removing protective screen. Don’t view this as a fault of the product. See how much they care about their reputation and your satisfaction. It would be a big mistake to go elsewhere is you need this product. BTW I’m sending payment anyway because they deserve it.
Original review: The product was packaged better than any similar items I have ordered online or at a store. The protector itself was exactly what I was hoping for. The instructions and set up kit were well thought out with one problem. The hinges were a poor method of applying the protector to the surface. I spent a lot of time preparing the surface and aligning to protector, but using the sticker hinges caused the device to be misaligned. On the second attempt it was better aligned but had particles underneath (I didn’t clean because it was only up for 15-30 seconds. I wish I had read more reviews about the application. I really want this product. I’ve never used one for more than a day or so because none seemed this quality. So for now I’ll have no protector unless I buy another one of these. I recommend buying one, but read the reviews, especially on using toothpicks. Or use all three stickers on long side maybe (not in instructions).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Very frustrating to work hard putting it on only to still have dust on the screen. But that’s not why I’m leaving a low rating/ it’s because I’ve had it two days and it is completely scratched up (hard to see in the picture). Also, when I use the touchscreen, there is a little give-like it’s slightly lifting up in the middle. I had it on a table to watch videos, and when it wasn’t on the table, it was inside a nice thick cushioned laptop bag. So essentially this has lasted two days, and now I’ll be hitting Best Buy to find a new protector. I bought this to replace another protector I had for over a year- no scratches on my old one, it just had a little crack after a year of protection.

First off, the installation tutorial felt cumbersome. I didn't mind but my friend kind of chuckled at all the steps. The real problem is the application of the screen.
I did all the step and there were still bubbles and I did try to get rid of them but they would not go. I went to reapply the screen (take the screen protector off and do  the steps over again).. still there were bubbles; even after I tried to get rid of them (mostly from the middle of the screen).

Shen","Bad installation setup. Had permanent bubble at the edge that won't go away.","November 29, 2016","Had trouble installing the screening with the ""sticker guides"". After using the sticker guides, it did not fix into the previous intended position. Had to readjust several times in positions after sticker on screen was peeled. After much usage of a gas duster to prevent dust, there is a permanent bubble at the bottom right edge of the screen (the sticky part of the screen seems to have worn out and does not stick to the ipad screen). On top of that, when trying to take of the ""guide stickers"", there are residues of the sticky part (cheap material?). I've had no problem with installation of Sparin's Iphone 7 plus screen, but the ipad pro installation is just a terrible experience. Only 2 stars just for the nice packaging.

Update: I can say Sparin had great customer service. Contacted me right away and offered a replacement. Installed this one without a problem.

Installing a screen protector is not rocket science. I've installed the tempered glass protectors on every smart phone and tablet inner house.... at least 2 dozen over the last five years. I am very careful to clean the screen and I always clean off my desk to eliminate dust/ pet hair / etc.... I know the routine. This screen protector was a whole new level of frustration. No matter what I did, it had air bubbles between the screen and tempered glass protector. I was able to remove it, clean the screen again... The end result is shown in the picture. That's the best outcome I could get. After a bit of research I found reports that said not all screen protectors are created equal. Cheap manufacturing processes can allow a very slight distortion in the tempered glass protector and air bubbles will appear immediately or within a few days. I'll spend a few more dollars and get a brand I've used before on our tablets. That will either prove my point cheap manufacturing or make me the idiot.... either one is possible.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I had bought this product and it was very hard to get rid of the bubbles. When I attempted to get rid of the bubbles with a thick tag, it left 2 small scratches. I initially did not like it because of the installation process causing bubbles, however, the customer service contacted me and offered to send another one to replace and try the installation again. I will update once I receive the product and have someone else install it for me. I like that the company values the opinion of the customer, reaches out to them and tries to improve the product. I believe that is what makes for a very good company. Thus, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase knowing that the company listens and honors the concern of the customer. The screen protector itself is very sturdy not flimsy at all . It came securely in a thick high quality frame book. You also receive a wet and dry wipe, along with a cleaning cloth and 3 stickers. The screen protector works great with the apple pencil and doesn't cause any problems or lag. One thing to note is that the screen protector covers the front view camera of the ipad. There is no small hole there, however it doesn't cause any problems or obstruction with the picture quality as the screen protector is clear. I would recommend to give this product a try because of the amazing customer service, you have nothing to lose. Also, be sure to watch the installation video before attempting to install to help reduce the chances of dust bubbles.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Factor","Installation system is bad, product is good.","January 10, 2018","I just installed this on my iPad 2017. The protector is extremely clear, thin, and lightweight.  Basically invisible.

However it was a struggle to get it properly applied. I read the instructions, I watched the YouTube videos, so it wasn’t me. The system provided is just not easy to use.

The protector is so slippery that getting it to hold still while you properly apply the “hinges” is almost impossible. I had to retry multiple times. If it moves, it won’t be properly aligned when you actually put it on.

Great care is then needed to get the protector on without reintroducing dust, because there is no remaining handle after you expose the adhesive.

I seem to end up buying a different brand of screen protector every time I get a new device, so I have used a bunch of different application systems. This one was the worst.

I usually go with a diff brand but having the Holiday time crunch and after reading reviews, I went with this product. The protector states its glass, but mine is plastic. Christmas is a few days away so I thought to install anyways. Wasnt to happy to find the adhesive side was already smattered w a fuzzy type particulate under the protective film (sandwiched between screen protector and plastic film). I used the ""dust absorber"" sticker gently to get as much off as possible and applied ""glass"" protector. Corners wont adhere and have bubbles. Will deal with it through Christmas and then buy a more trusted brand immediately after. Wouldnt reccomend this screen protector.

The only minor issues were that I had to push quite hard to get the last bubbles and the hinge won’t give you a perfect alignment but it’s not noticeable, especially if you have a Fintie cover as I do. One review said to apply the screen protector in a bathroom with the shower running which I did and I can’t say for certain this is necessary but a dust free environment is critical.  Even if you follow the steps exactly, if there is dust around it may show up on the screen. This is by far the best screen protector I’ve ever applied and so far as I’m concerned it’s earned the almost 5 star average rating. The other plus is that I priced a screen protector at Best Buy.

Previous review:I watched the YouTube video, followed all directions to a T and there is still a bubble that won’t adhere to the screen. I’ve used the little card to try and run it out, but nothing. Not sure it’ll stay on my brand new iPad long as the bubbles drive me crazy.

I gave this one stars because after using this on my iPad for awhile I began having serious issues with my eyes.  After using my iPad with this protector on it I began seeing things like sparklers and prism rainbows.  It is such a bad reaction I had to lie down and hope that these bright sparklers and bright rainbow colors would go away.  I tried using my iPad again the next day but as soon as I began looking at the screen the bright sparklers - rainbows began happening again.  So I removed the screen protector and after waiting for the bright lights and sparklers to stop I tried my iPad without the screen protector.  NO MORE bright lights, sparklers or rainbows!!

As plenty of reviewers before me have noted, the seller of this item provides excellent customer service. Within a day of my less than perfect review, I was contacted by iMaxas, and was offered a free replacement iPad screen protector. I received the replacement protector within a few days and have yet to replace the existing protector but am hoping for better luck with my second attempt.

Original review: I watched the YouTube instructional video twice,  reviewed the provided Installation Manual, prepped my area and iPad, and followed the step by step instructions exactly as written. Everything was good...until I removed the adhesive “hinges” and discovered a bubble under where the tape had covered the screen while adhering the screen protector. The Sparin Installation Manual does state that “all bubbles should disappear within a couple of days” but I’m skeptical of that since there appears to be a teeny, tiny particle in the center of the bubble that may prevent the bubble from disappearing. We shall see. If it does go away in a day or two, then I will update my review accordingly. If not, I’ll contact Sparin to seek advice.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I read the instructions and watched the suggested YouTube instruction video. The process is simple enough. HOWEVER, I missed a small speck of dust in the corner as I was placing the protector.  I noticed it right away and lifted the corner (which is where it was, right near the edge) and used the dust absorber again. The dust is gone but now the corner won’t adhere to the glass no matter how many times I tried to smooth it out, it just lifts again. Also, the area where I lifted now appears to be scratched even though I was super careful.

I’m pretty obsessive when aligning things and making sure it’s perfect so I was annoyed that I missed a speck of dust. Other screen protectors I have used in the past are more forgiving if you have to lift and replace them.

My advise to you is to check and double check that you have removed all dust (and while I didn’t have this problem, make sure it’s aligned properly too).  This protector is unforgiving. You get one shot at getting it right.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It covers the entire glass almost seamlessly. There's a tiny gap on one side but it's unnoticeable with my covers on. The edges are rounded and smooth so using the button isn't irritating.

The protector was really easy to apply, much easier than my phone's protector. It comes with the standard wet and dry wipes, microfibre cloth and squeegee card. I didn't even need the card. I laid it down button edge first and let it fall. A slight push in the middle made all the bubbles go away.

The protector's oleophobic properties are working great so far, much better than the original screen. There are still a few smudges here and there, but I clean my screen a whole lot less now. I use a generic stylus sometimes to reduce fingerprints but now I use my fingers more because there are less prints.

I received a replacement from SPARIN with video links for installing the screen glass.
This time around the glass fit Good but not perfect. I still feel like there is a bit space uncovered by the screen glass toward the right edges of the ipad pro 9.7.  And the Guide stickers provided with the package isn't used in the installation video, so I skipped that part myself. I wonder how it is used appropriately.
However, the positive aspect of it is there is no air bubbles trapped during the installation. And the biggest plus is, it doesn't hampers the functionality of apple pencil.

Old review:
The screen protector doesn't align well over the ipad screen. It is narrower toward the top and thereby leaves a large gap to one side of the ipad screen. Whats the point of screen protector which doesn't fit well over the ipad? Maybe I got a defective piece. I don't know.  I wrote to Sparin customer care and someone responded with a video link on how to install the protector, which doesn't solve the problem of it not fitting over the ipad screen.
Anyway, I can't recommend this product to anyone. Maybe only if you want to try your luck and get a good piece which fits.
The two stars is just for packaging and amazon's shipping.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_9?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=9&reviewerType=all_reviews"

EDIT","January 13, 2019","Having put on multiple screen protectors over the years, I set out to put this bad boy on with as much finness as all the rest. Alas, there was clearly dust particles underneath the protective film, rendering it impossible to have a dust free application. It fits perfectly on the iPad and you can’t tell that it is even there (except for the dust particles that were already on the screen protector when I received it). The hinge stickers are useless and make it more difficult. Practice on your own with the adhesive back on the protector first before committing to using them. Would have been a 5 star product but quality control seems to be lacking unfortunately.

You get cleaners and pads for cleaning your screen before you install the clear cover. I found the method pretty easy, just follow the directions. As to the protector, it seemed pretty good quality, fairly thick and sized properly. One thing the directions don't tell you is that you will need to get the air bubbles out. For this step, once you have the protector attached to the ipad and have already cleaned the screen, remove the clear plastic protection which exposes the ""sticky"" side of the protector and then simply curl it and roll it onto the screen.

I followed the directions exactly ... washing hands first, putting on the 'hinge' stickers, prepping the surfaces exactly. The iPad's screen was spotless, however when I pulled off the protective film from the backside of the protector, there was a tiny (like microscopic) piece of dust or lint on it (not the iPad screen, the protector). I don't know if it was just bad luck that it got there in that moment, or if it was on the protector to begin with, but it made an ugly bubble once the screen laid down. I had to remove the protector and try again, and it wouldn't come off and there were three new bubbles around the edges - I decided to stop trying to make it perfect, and just live with it. My concern is more of protection than aesthetics - after all this is for my son. None of the bubble are over the screen portion.

I'm usually good with things like alignment and precision, but you almost need to do this in a clean room to get it to work like the pictures and videos show. If I was using this professionally where appearances matter, I wouldn't recommend spending money on this unless you have a professional do it for you. Rather I'd just get a good folding case and be careful with it. But I am hopeful that the value is in how well it protects, and time will tell if that's the case.

Also, if you plan on putting your iPad in a tight-fitting case (my son's is in a keyboard case), I would NOT recommend trying to put the protector on first and then put the iPad in the case. My experience was that caused the protector to shift around.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Note: I did wear latex gloves because I tend to have oily skin. And I used the tabs, the wipes  and the dust absorber (basically a type of sitcky tape) as indicated in the directions.

I like that sparin provides you a wet, dry, and microfiber towel to clean your screen before installing the protector, because I thought I was going to have to clean the screen myself using some Kleenex’s and I wouldn’t have gotten it as clean if I had did that. I had no problem getting rid of the bubbles once put on the screen the only thing is I got this little circle print of something not sure what caused it because I mad sure not to touch the screen of my device and not to touch the sticky part of the protector when putting it on.

I attached the guide stickers as instructed and it did take some finesse to keep them on when the protector wasn’t flush against the screen (either while removing dust or pulling the plastic off of the protector), but considering that was the most challenging part it wasn’t that bad.  I skipped the wet and dry wipe downs, as I literally was just taking the iPads out of their boxes and plastic wrapping, so there was no dirt, fingertips, smudges etc.  I wasn’t going to take chances with dust though!  I went over every inch of the iPads several times with the dust-removing sticker before attaching the guides, after attaching the guides and after removing the plastic film from the screen protector (several times after this because I’d seen a review that said peeling the plastic film off causes static electricity which attracts dust), I was taking no chances!  It seemed to do the trick, as I slowly pulled the screen protector back into place over the screen, it began to seal out the air and “attach” to the screen perfectly.  No air bubbles and I didn’t even need to use the little cardboard square they provide to smooth away air bubbles.  As I did this with the 2nd and then 3rd iPads, I kept waiting for the inevitable air bubble.  I went 3/3 with not a single air bubble!  My guess is because the iPads were brand new.

That said, this went on fairly well. The biggest complaint is that the ""guide"" stickers were not adhesive enough to hold the glass in place as hinges, nor to use the third one as a handle to lower the glass onto the iPad. I ended up pulling the protector free of the hinges and just eyeballing it. I got three good sized bubbles toward the top, one silver dollar sized and the other two more dime sized. However, I was able to gently ease a fingernail under a corner and use the small, stiff, smoother to work the largest bubble to the edge. The two small air pockets were fairly easy to work to the edge using pressure on the protector.

Make sure the area where you are assembling to your IPad is clean and free of dust. I would have given 5 Stars, but once this screen comes even close to the iPad it sticks. I was very careful to place the hole over the finger button. As soon as the protector was near the screen it attached itself to the screen, I was just a tiny bit off. I could not move it again.

The first protector shattered from a short fall, with an excellent case protecting the device. I wanted a different brand but wasn’t clear about that before the order was made.

Both items were terrible to put on. The packaging, while impressive, worsens the situation. It causes increased static. If you use the ridiculous guide stickers, keep this is in mind. Not only will they allow shifting that will require lifting and secondary attempts, they increase the time for particles to build up. It’s better to just eyeball and adjust, which you won’t do if you just flop it over with the stickers.

The static draws everything to the adhesive side immediately. And the glass is fragile. It will crack during installation if you aren’t careful during adjustments. Or if you discover particles underneath...

The cleaning wipe is also absurd. Both times it created a film on a pre-cleaned surface. That requires extra time wiping after use.

The plastic tab for smoothing bubbles is a joke. Don’t waste time using it.

Guide stickers do not stick!  Screen full of dust.","January 13, 2018","The 2 star rating isn't necessarily for the tempered glass itself, but for the means of installation.  It should be first noted that my kit did not come with the dust removal sticker, so I was unable to complete that step as written in the instructions, as well as the steps in the video on YouTube. I always apply my own screen protectors to my devices, so I have relatively good experience with placing screen protectors.  When applying this one however, the screen protector kept sliding around as I was trying to measure the placement due to the protective sticker on the protector.  Also, when trying to place the guide stickers onto the screen protector for alignment, they always kept popping off and I would have to realign the screen and press the guide sitckers on again (this happened 3 times). I cleaned the screen as instructed, and as noted before, I could not complete the dust sticker removal step, as my kit did not come with one.  Dust still remained on my screen because of the microfiber cloth (keep in mind, I was installing the protector in a relatively dust-free area).  After removing the protective sticker from the glass, I flipped the glass as instructed and the guide stickers once again came off, adding more time to the installation process, therefore allowing some dust to settle onto the adhesive side of the tempered glass. There are dust particles stuck under the glass now and there are still some bubbles remaining.

I bought it to safeguard my 2017 iPad Air 2. The item was delivered on time and well packaged. The protector itself is so thin it's hard to believe it is glass but it is. The installation was very simple. Clean the glass with the products included and use the sticky film to remove any minute dust or particle and using the adhesive tabs to create a ""book"", peel the film back from the down side of the protector and drop in place.  Make sure to follow the directions and if you need to (I did because I was a little nervous I'd screw it up and must buy another one) follow a tutorial on YouTube. The protector really does adhere itself to the glass and I had only a minor bubble to push aside. It was easier than I thought it would be. The cut outs for the home button, camera, etc. line up perfectly. The thinness of the protector does not in any way interfere with the touch functions of my tablet.

The cut out for the home button was not ""on center"". It was slightly offset from the actual home button. I may be picky by it seems a simple fix would be making the hole a little bigger. It is unpleasant to feel the edge of the cut out every time you touch the home button. Also, I wasn't expecting the entire top of the screen protector would be cut short to accommodate the face camera hole. Seems a simple fix to just cut out around the hole so the screen protector covers more of the top of the screen. As it is the screen protector stops about 1/2"" from the top of the iPad. I will be returning this.
UPDATE: in my initial review I critiqued the size of the screen not covering the entire screen. While in function this may be true it makes little difference in the long run. When I finally installed it the process was simple. Not sure why folks are complaining about bubbles. For me there were none. I am supposing the negative reviews have more to do with user error than the product itself. This product is going to preserve the resale value of my iPad 100 times over.

Durable? no.","August 4, 2018","I purchased this soon as I got my iPad without much searching because I wanted to have a screen protector delivered as soon as possible. Maybe I should have researched it a bit more before deciding to purchase it. It came in a very nicely packaged sturdy looking case with hardcover and styrofoam on all sides. On the third day of using it, I dropped my iPad (from maybe 2 1/2 ~ 3in height to my desk) and it cracked.  I should have learned my lesson from the first one but I didn't. So I purchased the second one. Thankfully it didn't crack BUT I just noticed that near one of the corner was chipped. I haven't dropped it nor given any damages (that I remember of) so I am very curious as to how it chipped and it's slowly making itself larger.
I would have said it may not be for me but people who don't take their iPad outside should be fine BUT I am one of those people who doesn't take their iPad outside of home. So would I recommend this one to a friend? No.

Thick, sturdy, actually has a full cutout for the fingerprint sensor (unlike some I've seen), and is crystal clear. I give it 3 stars based on their install process, and my recommendations for a better install. Due to a job I previously held I used to do screen protector installations on a daily basis, and have installed countless screen protectors. With that said, I was intrigued by their sticker hinge install idea. I thought it might be the best install process I've seen yet, however the stickers didn't stick well to the screen protector, and stuck too much to my iPad, leaving a residue that I had to rub off. Their dust magnet tool also leaves residue on the screen, so I recommend to skip the dust magnet step. A microfiber and some elbow grease can get a screen perfectly clean. I recommend cleaning the screen before attaching the sticker hinge as while cleaning, if your iPad moves on the table, it drags the screen protector across the table potentially scratching it. Use lots of light and turn off ALL the fans/air conditioning or heating to keep as much dust from floating around as possible. wait about 10 minutes after everything is off to let the dust settle, then clean the screen very well. Tempered glass screen protectors show dust under the screen protector much more obviously than typical vinyl screen protectors. I have also docked another star for the poor bevel on the fingerprint cutout, causing it to be somewhat sharp. I hope this helps. If the supplier reads this, please update your instructions with my recommendations to assist future customers.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Followed reviewer suggestions for optimal placement.","March 3, 2018","Arrived on time, well packaged, undamaged. As per the advice of other reviewers, I allowed the screen protector 24 hours to come to room temperature before installing. I hate bubbles, so I found a clean library room and waited until the AC fan was off (didn't want anything blowing around). Pre-cleaned my screen with an old lens cloth just because I'm paranoid. The cleaning kit that came with the screen protector is appreciated, although there were two items that weren't mentioned in the instructions: one dry wipe, and a pull tab (I assumed it was to be used to position the screen, although I didn't use it and did fine). As per instrutions, I pre-positioned the screen protector, then applied the hinge stickers. I realized too late that I had placed the screen protector wrong-side up, but no worries! The hinge stickers weren't excessively sticky, and I was able to remove them without problems or damage. I re-placed the screen protector and hinge stickers, and gave placement a few practice tries as per other reviewers suggestions. I followed the cleaning instructions, and if I could take just half a star off, I would: the dust wipe left a film on the screen that, had I not noticed, would have caused problems. No worries, the microfiber dust cloth took care of the film and the screen was pristine. I placed the screen protector easily, sealed it to the screen, and removed the hinge stickers. Works beautifully, and I honestly can't even tell its here except that the glare is noticeably reduced (which is why I purchased this in the first place).","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_17?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=17&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The product came in a big brown shipping envelope, you know the ones with the bubble wrap inside. That could have been dangerous except for the sturdy book-like holder of the glass. That took my rating to 4 stars.

The fifth star was for instructions which came in 2 forms. For people who are print oriented, there were written instructions. For those of us who are more visually oriented, there were instructions on YouTube. (There were cleaning/drying packets included for the screen, too!)

Wylie","Does the job","April 23, 2017","Overall, I am very happy with this. I had to take it on and off a few times to get it straight, but it went on well and has no bubbles or anything like that. The secret is in the preparation. Get the screen as clean as you possibly can and do not touch the sticky side of the protector. If I have any quibbles it is that the screen is very glossy. Seems more glossy that before so more reflections than some screen protectors. It also is supposed to minimize fingerprints. Not sure on that score, but it does clean up nice and gives a sharp unobstructed view of your screen.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_19?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=19&reviewerType=all_reviews"

First, the pros........great packaging and great product.  Screen protector is light weight and does not change the sensitivity of the screen or the clarity.  Apple Pencil still works great.  Would recommend to friends as an excellent price.  However, the cons...........as others have said, the guide stickers don't work as expected which is frustrating.  The concept of using the guide stickers as ""hinges"" and a ""handle"" is great.......if it worked.  However, the stickers don't hold.  You end up having to reposition the screen using your hands while trying to keep your fingerprints off the underneath side of the screen.  It would be better to not offer the guide stickers if they are not going to work.  In my case, I thought they were working when they came loose and the screen slipped sticking off center.  I was able to pull the screen up and successfully reposition.  I was also able to work out all but 2 small air bubbles but hope they will disappear within 48 hours as instructions indicated.  I would make the reference to ""SPARIN Michael"" on YouTube much more prominent as that installation video is very helpful; much more so than the written instructions which are a little weak.  Of course, it won't matter where you get instruction if the guide stickers aren't fixed.  So, bottom line, gave 4 stars as I think the product is great but the installation process needs some work.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_35?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"

This product includes:
1. Stickers to help positioning
2. Screen Cleaning kit (wet cleaner, dry cleaner, microfabric cleaner)

These two help a lot, more than expected. You can completely remove dusts from your screen. And you can very easily place the protector on your screen using the simple sticker kit.

Before this, I always struggled to remove dusts and to place it correctly. I used to try this in bathroom to minimize dusts and detached and attached a film multiple times to find correct position. But SPARIN solved the problems very easily with the simple kits.

Lucky for me, while the crack was not attractive it didn't create any issues with usability. Checked about getting it fixed but a replacement screen cost almost as much as a refurbished iPad. Since the crack was barely noticeable, decided to get a screen protector to guard against any further damage. Saw many comments warning against using a screen protector after a crack, but followed the instructions (both the booklet and the YouTube video) and it went on easily, without any bubbles. There was a little air pocket that formed along the crack but I used my fingers and the enclosed squeegee to get rid of that.

The screen comes with detailed instructions for a good install. Something went wrong during my install, a stray little particle of something landed on the screen and created a stubborn bubble. Their support was extremely responsive. They walked me through fixing the problem and really stayed on top of the situation. That's a lot of support for such a low-ticket item. Very impressive. I would purchase other things from this company. Seems to be part of a new generations of companies, Chinese I guess, that offer low prices, quality products, AND excellent support to end U.S. users.

Probably a nice product, but after applying multiple iphone / ipad screen protectors in the past; I should have gone with what worked for me instead of following the manufacturer's directions.

Specifically, it calls for using the supplied tape pieces to form a ""hinge"" after lining up the screen protector.  Despite using all 3 of the provided hinge tapes; the adhesive was so poor, it pulled right off from my new iPad 9.7.  And once you remove a screen protector; it becomes covered w- dust particles.

What date were you born?SubmitAdobe Flash Player is required to watch this video.Install Flash Player Video review:

I bought this screen protector because...
1) I serve in developing countries filming for nonprofits (through Knok Studio) and I put a ton of stress on my devices and...
2) I have 2 young children.  Who are also on the road with me, serving in tough-on-technology countries.

So I thought, ""Why not add a 10 dollar added layer of protection to my $400 device?"" Right?

But in the long run I found this iPad screen protector doesn't really add that much to the apparent protection.  For me the amount of 'stickiness' you get (compared to the smooth iPad glass) is not worth it. Plus the possibility of putting this protector on without getting dust underneath is slim to none.  (see end of video and note all the bubbles around the edges... and I followed the instructions meticulously)

Honestly I would simply invest in a quality case that folds over the glass when not in use (like a book).

Do note: For a smart phone, it's different. I would actually suggest a screen protector because a small, phone device is always jostling up against keys in your pocket. iPads and tablets are different; when you're toting them around, they're always covered by the case.

Side note: If it's worth the gamble for you to buy and attempt a perfect, dust-free installation, more power to you. It's nice because if all else fails, there's no glue or sticky residue left on your original screen from this screen protector. So if you choose to peel it off and dispose of it (like I'm going to do most likely), your iPad is back to normal.  That's nice.

Hope this is helpful!

Never had one of this quality before.  It was super simple to apply  although I admit I did not have the patience to use the included wet/dry wipes or the marker stickers.  I simply cleaned my screen with a microfiber cloth, removed the plastic to reveal the adhesive, then lined up the home button and the sides of the iPad before slowly lowering the protector onto it.  That's it.  Literally had zero bubbles or dust underneath.  The thing that truly blew my mind though was the coating.  I don't know what kind of oleophobic nanotechnology this company is using but it does NOT pick up fingerprints.  At ALL.  I tried smudging and smearing and dragging my fingers all over it.  Not a single mark.  I'm seriously impressed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","",""

It was exactly what I was looking for.  I appreciated the quality of the product, the pretty pink color, and how sparkly the glitter on it was!  If you like shimmer, glitter, and sparkle this is your case!  What I love the most about it, is that even though it is glittery it is still a classy case that can be used in a variety of professional settings.  The case not only looks good, but it also has protected my iPad during multiple incidents where it was dropped.  I would have given this case five stars, but my stylus pen that it came with completely stopped working within 3 days.

This does the job, and lets all my touches through with no hesitation or need to push hard.

One thing: While I do appreciate the inclusion of the 'installation kit' for guaranteeing an absolutely perfect application of the protector, I find that just by eyeballing it and being halfway dexterous, I can put it on just fine (and perfectly, no bubbles after smoothing it down) with no assistance needed. Same with other screen protectors. It's handy for people who aren't as confident in their fine motor coordination, I get it.

Watch before to apply the screen protector.

The ""hinges"" really help!  Simple idea that really works.  I still had to adjust as I was placing the protector.
Even after wiping and cleaning the screen I still managed to get a few dust particles caught between the screen and protector.  I peeled the protective screen up and used the sticky ""dust-absorber"" to pull the dust particles off the sticky side of the protector.  Worked like a charm!  Whew!  So all told, once I aligned, hinged, reset, re-cleaned and such - about 20 minutes - and a great finish with my iPod well protected.  Would by again.

I suspect any difficulties I have are due to the fact that I put one of these on once ever couple of years.

The reviews were accurate.  Everything you would need to install the screen protector is in the package...the stickers to help get it on straight, the cleaning and drying wipes, the microfiber cloth and simple directions.  The directions also refer you to a video on YouTube if you want even more information on how to install.  I watched the short video as I was installing it step by step.  It was extremely user friendly and the screen is perfect.  I don't really think most people would even need the video but I wanted to make sure I didn't have any bubbles in the screen.  It is amazing how once the protective cover is removed that this screen protector just adheres to the iPad screen practically without me having to touch it again.  I just had to smooth out a few bubbles with the cloth and device included.

All of the materials for prepping the screen came packaged nicely as well.  Unfortunately, the screen protector itself appears to have had several specs of dust/dirt underneath the protective film - not noticeable prior to installing the screen protector, but very noticeable once the protector is on the iPad.  I've read that other buyers have had similar issues.  It is unfortunate, because the screen protector is otherwise great, just a case of faulty packaging.

*EDIT*
Note that this is an update to my original review.  I had originally given this 2 out of 5, despite quite liking the product.
The customer service has changed my mind and I'm willing to give this a 5 out of 5.  Alisa from iMaxas reached out to me immediately regarding my review above, and a replacement protector was sent to me.  This was a completely unexpected level of customer service - very much appreciated.  The replacement protector was particle free and installed perfectly.  Despite the low price, this seems to be a quality screen protector.  It works really well with my Apple Pencil, including pressure recognition for apps that support it.  I will note that drawing/writing with the Pencil feels similar to drawing/writing on a white board rather than paper, however this was never marketed as a paper solution.  If you are looking for a screen protector that feels like paper, consider looking at a matte protector - something that feels grainier.  However, I've enjoyed my time with the protector.  It is a quality product and the customer service is incredible.

One last thing to mention - there is a 2 pack for almost the same price as this one pack.  Buy that one.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_14?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"

There was an envelope with detailed instructions and wet, dry and microfiber cleaners plus some adhesive strips to hold the position ofmthe glass before final placement. Everything you could ask for, except it didnt work. Mfg claims that simply r7nning your finger down the middle of the glass will kick off installing itself. Mine never did. I had 6 large bubbles under the glass that never resolved. Returned for
Update: mfg saw my review and sent me email offering to provide me with another protector to have me try again. They also suggested I watch several Youtube videos on how to install the screen protector.  Its a good thing I did because the videos provide different instructions than the mfg’s written instruction included with the product. This begs the question, why doesnt the mfg change their instructions? Following the video instructions, I was able to successfully install the screen protector in about 5 minutes.....and it largely installed itself.

Before the product even arrived, I had received an email from the seller/product company.  The email thanked me for my purchase and also told me how to go online and watch a video of how to install the screen protector.  The email also said to contact the seller if I had any troubles or needed anything.  I thought this was very good customer service to get an email even before the product had arrive.  Usually I find customer service to be very reactive, and this was a very proactive approach which I liked.

After the product arrived, I watched the recommended video, along with a couple of additional videos on how to install the screen saver.  I tried to followed the videos on how to install but I still had a little trouble installing the screen saver.  There are tabs included that you are suppose to stick to the screen saver and the Ipad and use them like a hinge.  However, these tabs did not stick to the Ipad very well and would slip and move.  This would throw off the alignment of the screen saver.  I finally had to get someone to help me and help hold the tabs in place and finally get the screen saver located where I wanted it.  For me it was a little more difficult to install then the videos I had watched, but it wasn't terrible.

Overall the product is good it is now protecting my screen and I don't have any scratches or smudges on the original screen.  Outside of the small difficulty I had installing the screen saver the only other downside I have found is that it adds some glare to the screen that wasn't there before.

The biggest issue with this kit is that it only ships with one piece of tempered glass whereas the other kits I""ve purchased from other manufacturers shipped with a second screen protector.

The pull tab to remove the plastic sheet from the tempered glass is at the top, and no camera cutout hole or other cue is available to properly align the protector.  There is only one hole cut out for the home button, and aligning the tempered glass from the top of the ipad down to to the home button is challenging.  If a second hole was present for the camera, installation alignment would be far easier. Alternatively, if the pull tab was located on the bottom of the glass near the home cut out, the alignment would be much easier.

Once installed, the touch screen interface works flawlesslly and screen color is unchanged.  The protector has been installed for less than an hour, and I can't speak to the product's durability.

The overall margin of error to install this kit accurately is extremely narrow, especially for an individual who has never emplaced a screen protector before. If the kit included a second screen protector, the process would be far more forgivable. Due to the installation challenges and, more importantly, the absence of a second piece off glass, I highly recommend looking for a different product.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Also, I read many reviews that said that no matter how much they cleaned they still got bubbles due to lint. Thats exactly what happened to me. I was installing protector onto my brand new iPad. Even though it was brand new, we still cleaned it. There was absolutely no lint or dust on it. We install this cover and there are 4 bubbles due to dust/lint trapped underneath. This cover I guess is static and attracts dust and lint and pulls it in not the sticky side. So now I have permanent bubbles.
So I am confused. This company reaches out to unhappy customers (which is nice) but keeps on selling effective product? Do you notice many many reviews dating their rating due to great customer service? How about getting product fixed so that it doesn't have static and attract dust/lint. How about product getting better instead of great customer service. Well, anyway I have bubbles and its awful.
Update: one big bubble is left, tiny ones disappeared. Still not good and distracting but at least is not many.","3.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

You really have to get your iPad, iPhone super clean and not a speck of dust anywhere. And then line up the screen protector with your iPad screen precisely. Don't rush it, let it grab your screen and push out the bubbles on its own. After, take your finger to push out any bubbles left. Push them all the same direction or they won't get out. You can redo, but ideally is best to get it right the first time. Whatever you do, do NOT touch the sticky side AT ALL once you pull back the film. This will only create a forever smudge on your screen because of it. Basically just follow the directions exactly. Awesome and great product, durable and packaged very nicely.

When I received the email from SPARIN asking me to review the product it still had not arrived due to a shipping error by Amazon. So basically the email just went unnoticed. When the product did arrive, I immediately was impressed by the packaging. A heavy weight box with a great presentation to even include an icon that read ""explosion proof."" I want to test that part. When I opened the box I again was impressed. The screen protector was surrounded by a foam rubber frame to protect it, and also encased by two protective layers of styrofoam wrap. The company enclosed all of its literature in an envelope that made me think I was getting a greeting card along with my screen protector. They even included a ""happy / not happy"" card that reiterates their desire to provide you a good product or they will do what they can to make it right.
As for the screen protector, it seems solid. It has been on my iPad for less than 24 hours, and as long as it stands up to the torture that I know I will put it through, I am beyond happy with my purchase.

And the screen protector itself is great. I just put it on with no problem (I did watch the video, being an easily-led person), and I expect it to serve me well. In the past I've had film screen protectors, which in fact have worked just fine, but this was easier to put on and should afford even better protection.
One trick I remember from installing my previous covers: do it on a good flat surface in a bathroom after having run the shower for 3-4 minutes and then waited 5"": as it settles, the steam will drag any dust out of the air in an already relatively dust-free space. And no matter where you perform the operation, be sure you've turned off AC or heat blowers before you do the deed.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I use my Apple Pencil with my iPad constantly, especially for art, so scratches are something I have to be really careful to avoid because they really interfere with the smoothness of my Pencil strokes. Unfortunately small grains can get underneath the Pencil tip and when I press down on the Pencil, it will scratch the screen. So I have to use a screen protector to prevent scratching the actual screen. I anticipated small scratches like this from Pencil strokes and was fine with it not being totally scratch resistant as long as it protected my iPad and didn’t crack.

All in all, a good buy. Plus it helps keep my iPad screen scratch-free!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_16?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=16&reviewerType=all_reviews"

However, I cleaned the screen of the tablet and it looked perfect but after I had put the protector on I noticed a few dust specs. I had to lift the screen protector a few times to remove all the dust. Unfortunately this must have done some damage to the edges. There are a few small spots (on the edge) where the protector isn't sticking perfectly to the screen. Logging in with my fingerprints wouldn't work either after I installed the screen protector. I had to re-scan my fingerprints so that the tablet would recognize them. It works now but not as well as it did without protector.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_33?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=33&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Most of these things, including this one is made to be as  cheap as possible and most profit.  I ripped this one off my iPad and threw it in the trash.  Not even worth returning.

What I don't like.... too glossy and not matt finish so a lot of glare.  It's not glass and falsely implied in the ad and on the box.  It is a polycarbonate.  Thus it is very static like when installing and attracts dust that you must be super careful to remove during installation.  It leaves even more fingerprints than by using the iPad directly.  It's also just a bit too large.  They try to go edge to edge on the iPad so when putting the iPad in a tight case, the edges of the product  are pushed up or in with pressure and come away from the surface slightly.  It also annoys me that when pressing the home button, I feel the edges of the cutout circle as the product is thick.

I'll go back to try and find the older style very think coatings that don't have the above problems.  They might be a bit more delicate to install, but none of the downsides.  I already have a case that mainly protects the iPad so this this plastic is a nuisance.","1.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I must say that I can appreciate the tempered glass screen protector from Sparin.

The Sparin Tempered-Glass Screen protector package comes with everything that is necessary for a novice to install this screen protector. The instructions are thorough and easy to follow. It was a simple install that took me 15 minutes. Came out better than any other screen protectors I've installed. And this is my first tempered glass screen protector install. I definitely plan to stick with tempered glass screen protectors, for they are designed to resist the cracking of the device's screen.

When it came, I watched the YouTube video before even attempting to install this. I watched it a second time while following the installation steps. My first issue was with the installation stickers. I applied them to the screen and then unstuck them and repositioned them to get the screen protector more even around the home button. After that, the stickers did not stick well, making the protector crooked right before I was ready to pull off the protective layer and install. At some point a crack formed on the side opposite the home button. I decided to try to continue installation to protect the iPad until I could replace this protective glass. I gently tried to unstick the installation stickers and reposition which then resulted in a huge crack. Now I'm not sure if I should even try to install this temporarily until I can get a new one or if installing it might cause the screen protector to scratch the ipad screen, especially when removing it.

Upon unveiling the protector, I noticed a few things: 1 - it was not flimsy, and yet it was not incredibly thick and heavy. 2 - It did not easily bend, which led me to believe that this was no cheap plastic. 3 - it was crystal clear and unmatted, unlike most screen protectors. 4 - included in the box were a set of instructions (with pictures) and things to clean and de-dust the screen for when you apply the protector.

Applying the screen was easier than opening the package. For me, it NEEDED to be perfectly centered on the iPad, so accomplishing that, for me, was difficult. There were zero bubbles. I noticed a speck of dust in the corner keeping the protector raised a bit, so lifting the protector to remove the speck was easy, and it left no adhesive residue.

The crack doesn’t hinder use of my iPad but it is definitely noticeable. I would have hoped for a longer lasting protector than just 24 hours - and I haven’t even dropped it! I have read other reviews and I hope their customer service will see this and connect with me. I would be glad to change/update my review if I can get a replacement which holds up longer than one day of use!","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_38?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=38&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Let me start by saying this screen protector is probably fine for most people. However, I am one of those extremely picky and borderline obsessive people when it comes to the way my device's screens look and perform.

CONS:
Glare... The screen of the iPad Pro is something very unique in that it has a new anti-glare coating that works extremely well. Especially when outdoors. I primarily use this iPad when flying my Phantom drone so this is very important to me. I thought maybe there was a chance that putting this thing on would only slightly degrade this anti-glare coating, but boy was I wrong! Having this protector on the iPad made it almost unusable outside - worse than the Air/Air 2 screen. Bottom line here, it's a shame to even think about putting anything over the iPad Pro's stock glass!

Distortion... I noticed that aside from the glare, at certain angles the picture was slightly distorted. There were also strange rainbow-looking artifacts in certain lighting which started driving me crazy.

PROS:
Packaging... The protector comes packaged extremely well with ample instructions and tools to get it installed correctly.

Oleophobic coating... The glass is covered in a film that feels silky smooth when you touch it and also repels fingerprints and dust very well.

Price... You can't beat the price of this thing for what you get.

Customer service... This company has been great to work with. It's always comforting to purchase from a company that takes pride in their product.

CONCLUSION:

If you're not going to be using your iPad outside a whole lot and you are not a snobby perfectionist like myself, this is a great option.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_11?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=11&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Everything I needed to clean the screen and apply the screen protector was included, as well as detailed installation instructions. Within a few minutes it was in place and ready to go. No smudges, no scratches, and it's still every bit as sensitive as the screen was without.

I appreciated the video showing the installation as well as providing ""guide"" stickers which are also very useful. Unfortunately this item has to be returned because I have never had any issues installing a screen protector before but after several attempts with this one, I was unable to eliminate either bubbles or dust.

However, the instructions and video are a great combination and method to install the glass. I don't think it's possible to install it perfectly unless you have a dust free room. Thinking about it, I would take a long hot shower, close the room and let all the dust stick to the walls and the air to be still. This will give you a shot at a dust free install.

I was able to apply it with only one bubble that I can't get rid of. Not a deal-breaker for me. The installation is a little strange since you guide the glass with pieces of tape but I guess it makes for an easy installation.

I really like how clean the display looks when compared to my phone that has a plastic protector. The screen is very responsive to the touch with a glass protector, I feel. The protector isn't too thick but is noticeable at an angle or by touch. The protector works fine with my NewTrent keyboard case for the iPad 5.

 - Better look and feel than plastic
 - Very responsive to touch
 - No breaks or cracking yet : )

I looked through my Amazon purchases and discovered whom I purchased the protective screen shield from . Previously I always used the soft plastic ones this one is made from tempered glass and it has a much better feel. I contacted Sparin and they requested that I send a photo of the damage, shortly after that they sent me the procedure to use on Amazon to get a replacement at no cost to me. Hopefully I will never need another replacement but I will definitely be considering other Sparin products in the future.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_40?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=40&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unfortunately, I picked the wrong install video, even though I followed the printed instructions to look it up on YouTube.  The manufacturer's video didn't show up in the first few choices, so I picked the most viewed video.  Would be nice if there was a better way to find the manufacturer's video, like maybe through a link at their website.  Despite the confusion, the install went well but I couldn't get 3 trapped bubbles out.  They were about dime-sized.  Since I could move them around with the card provided, I knew they weren't trapping a dust particle.  I just couldn't get them all the way to the edge to get them out.  The instructions said any bubbles should go away in a few days, and they were gone within 4 days.  I liked installing this much better than the ""wet application"" that so many other screen protectors use.

After driving myself half-mad repeatedly peeling the protector off the iPad to attempt yet another cleaning, it broke under the stress and that was that. I dashed off a review detailing my disappointment and was contacted by the seller with an offer to have another go free of charge. I accepted and a few days later I once again pushed my patience to its limit trying to get a clean seal; with a high-powered magnifier and a bright work light I was finally able to chase away nearly every visible speck of dust and got the darned thing to land with a few acceptable blemishes.

As to the product.  Now that the thing is on, I can say it is sized to fit the iPad perfectly.  My Apple Pencil still works with no discernable effect from the glass sheet. And, since I managed to break one before, I can report that even in the unlikely event of breakage, the panel behaves like a automobile windshield and remains intact--no danger of shards or splinters. And the seller certainly stood by the product.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_20?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=20&reviewerType=all_reviews"

No I did not have it near anything that could possibly attract the lint. I did it on a table after washing my hands to make sure I attracted no lint and still there ended up being some. I returned product and am purchasing a different brand.

Revised (04/17/2018). Great customer service I'll say that much. I was sent a free replacement to help make my experience better than it had been the first go round. However, I didn't notice until I was looking at the new glass cover I received that the camera is covered up by the glass. I didn't like that and don't know how well you can still see if the glass covers the camera. I had already purchased a new screen cover from the same brand that I purchased from for my Nintendo Switch. That did not cover my camera and was beyond easy to use so.... I didn't use the new cover and probably won't since I already have one on it. So if you don't mind covering your camera on the front of the iPad then maybe it will work for you.

I needed this as I'm a bit of a klutz and didn't want the hell scratched out of my new iPad's screen.  Installation was a bit nerve-wracking, as I wanted to get it right the first time, but if you follow the included simple instructions, it'll work out.

Here's a few thoughts:

- DO NOT be in a hurry when you sit down to install this thing.
- Clear a 20 minute window of time in a room away from pets/kids/fans/moving air
- Read the instructions and TAKE YOUR TIME!
- Start work on the alignment.  There's no penalty for taking your time.
- Take extra time to gently press the stickers down, as they'll come loose otherwise
- Check your alignment again.  Get an idea of what it looks like along the left corners when aligned properly.
- De-dust RIGHT before you pull the adhesive cover
- Once the glass makes contact and begins adhering, SLOWLY let it settle on its own.  It'll adhere without bubbles if you don't rush it.

If you followed the included simple instructions, it should work out just fine.  I had no air bubbles and it looks great!

I'll update if durability becomes an issue.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_41?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=41&reviewerType=all_reviews"

It came beautifully packaged in a stiff cardboard ""book"" type box sealed with a label. When you open it there is a quality foam border all around the glass. The glass itself was inside a nice plastic sleeve inside of a soft foam envelope. The instructions, a nice company card with instructions on one side for if you are happy with the product how to share and leave a review, and if you are not happy on the other side a promise to make it right with customer service contact details, the application tools and stickers all inside of a nice unmarked kraft brown envelope. I'm not big on a lot of useless packaging but you can easily convert the box into something you could use again and definitely use the envelope again instead of them ending up in a landfill. As for the product itself...beautiful. You are given all the tools you need to apply this to your device. There is even a YouTube prompt on the instruction booklet so you can watch it live before you try. I had no problems at all getting this onto my iPad Pro. I even put it on crooked the first time and was able to slowly and carefully lift it back off and reapply it. Then, I did have a couple of air bubbles (the second time I applied it) and was able to easily lift each corner until the air bubbles were accessible and lay the glass back down perfectly. The one thing I think would have made it easier and might have kept me from having to do a second application is the the tab on the protective cover on the sticky side of the glass could have been on the ""bottom"" (where the home button is) instead of the top so that I could have lined that part up right away instead of last. The great thing is that the home button hole is the only hole to line up. This glass fits edge to edge and is beveled all the way around. Even the good one I have on my phone leaves a 1/8 - 1/4 inch gap all the way around. This glass is a great companion to the Bluetooth keyboard iPad case I also bought from an equally fabulous company. This company really put a lot of thought into all of their systems from packaging to product to customer service. That deserves a reward.

I watched the YouTube video that was recommended on the instruction sheet before beginning the installation so I would know exactly what to do and what not to do. All went well on the installation until, in spite of my best efforts, I got a couple of small dust particles on the screen that were on the viewing area. The video did not cover how to remove them but I had read another review that said to carefully lift the protector from the corner, use the dust remover the remove the particles FROM THE STICKY BACK OF THE PROTECTOR (in other words, “upside down”)and let the protector return to position. During this process, additional dust crept onto the protector nearer the edge and I carefully repeated the process.  I finally have a screen with no dust bubbles in the viewing area but the corner that was lifted no longer is adheared to the screen.

I had luck with tempered glass covering my other devices in the past, so I was happy to find one for my new iPad (2017). The cut out for the home button and the edges all matched up perfectly with the device. They provide you with all of the cleaning materials (wipes, dust collector, etc.) so you don't need to clean with Windex beforehand. What I thought was a nice touch is they provide you with an instruction booklet, but also give you a YouTube search keyword in case you'd like to watch a video tutorial. Installation was simple, and I was left with no bubbles caught under the protector.

When I was contacted by Eos at SPARIN to follow up on this product purchase, I relayed what happened and what I did.  He was very concerned and adamant about sending me another one at no charge, along with additional instructions in video form to help me with the installation.  Eos went out of his way to support me and ensure that I would be successful in applying the IPad protector.  He was in touch with me daily on my progress.  The videos were of tremendous help and I applied it with success.  In fact when I emailed Eos back to let him know my results, I also told him that I was ordering another one for my husband.  Surprisingly, Eos responded back requesting my order number so he could apply a 20% discount to my account for my second order.  I've got to say that his customer service was outstanding and I would highly recommend this product provided by SPARIN.

I had to look for one that would work for me especially when it comes to smudges. I use my iPad a lot in the kitchen, so you can only imagine! I ordered this SPARIN Tempered Glass Screen protector. I read the instructions on the small booklet and the direction to watch SPARIN A09 video on YouTube. That helped simplify things! However, I missed the placement of the iPad (which direction the home button was supposed to be facing before installing! When all was done, I didn’t have a home button! Of course it was there but covered with the screen protector! Went back to see if I read it wrong which iPad it works for and truly it works for my iPad Air 9.7”. The lights came on that watching the video, I didn’t pay attention to how the iPad was laid down and what was facing where! I took the risk of using the little card scrapper (comes in the installation package) to gently tip one corner and the carefully grab the protector without touching the inside (that touches the screen), then after peeling it off, holding by the edges turn it around to where the opening for the home button is directly centered over my home button and then gently place it and even it out! Didn’t need to reclean the screen, not even touch it. After the screen protector laid squarely on the iPad, I then used the same card and the wipe cloth provided to squish out the air bubbles. I ended up with a perfect, very responsive screen and found the home button too!

I’d mistakenly bought these thinking there as two in the pack... but there’s just one.  Rather pricey for just one when everyone else offering glass screen protectors for iPad 6/iPad Pro 9.7in at the same price point includes two.

Mine, when it arrived, was shipped in a thinly padded envelope.  The box had a crease in it.  When I initially looked at the screen protector, I didn’t see any cracks or damage so I installed.  The installation went well.  The n stand day, I noticed a big hairline crack. I couldn’t believe my eyes.  This is where the second one would’ve been useful/helpful.  I nearly ordered another different brand when a customer service rep sent me an email asking how the installation went.  I told them that on the second day there was a crack already and that it may have been damaged out of the box.  They quickly sent me a new one.

Would I recommend Sparin?  Yes, to a degree.  Watch the item your wanting to buy.  It seems they list several offerings of the same item but at different prices.  Usually one far more than the other.  And then some with just one when the other has two included.  And some at the same price as the just one.  Very tricky.

T.","Great product, great company, very happy!","February 12, 2017","Firstly, I'd like to thank SPARIN for standing behind their product and for their one of a kind customer service. Both my son and I had ordered from SPARIN for our galaxy tablet and surface pro. Both got ruined but SPARIN gladly replaced them without any questions asked. The replacement installments came out perfect in first attempt. Secondly, because of their excellent customer service, I decided to order from them again when it came time to protect my iPad Pro, even though there were cheaper options on Amazon, but SPARIN's product guarantee has me hooked as their returning customer. By the way, my iPad glass protector install came out perfect in first attempt. The company provides all necessary tools for easy installation. I personally, used scotch tapes to hold down the included self adhesives. Learned my lesson from the first two failed attempts. (It works flawlessly in bathroom with steam present to eliminate dust particles. Thanks to other reviewers for pointing this out.) Thank you!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I added the two other stars because after the first review (see below) the shipper/company contacted me with apologies & swiftly sent a free replacement.
I also received it swiftly & had no problems with this replacement.  I would differently use product/company again & also refer.
While waiting I did read some of the other reviews & noticed how many corner bubble issues others we having.  Don’t know if it’s the product or the customer placement of the product. All I know is that I followed the instructions...again to a tee but guess maybe somehow dust was in the corner even though I used the dust protector wipe.
All I can say is that “I’m happy now” & Thank you
Bunny for all your swift help.

First review:
I followed the instructions to a tee however in the left bottom corner of the screen/iPad after placing, I have a bubble that won’t go away. Per the instruction any bubble would go away after a couple days...it’s been WAY over that period ...almost a month.  Beware of Bubbles!!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_22?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=22&reviewerType=all_reviews"

DO NOT LIFT AND RE-APPLY as it might not stick all the way, around the entire perimeter of your device's screen.","February 5, 2018","Seems fine. Good quality. The claim that you can stick it on the screen and pull it up if you made a mistake during alignment, isn't true.  There was a portion of the glass NOT sticking onto the iPad screen and no matter what I did, it'd lift enough just to know it was there. Fortunately, that unused portion of the screen (the surrounding glass frame around the screen) is covered by the protective cover I'm using so it's actually being sandwiched down at all times and out of sight.  Without that, I would I have probably sent it back.

When you apply this cover, MAKE SURE YOU ARE TOTALLY ALIGNED BEFORE YOU STICK the tempered glass protective cover onto the iiPad's screen! If you have to re-lift and re-apply, you'll most likely run into the problem of having a corner or two, not sticking all the way.","4.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_13?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=13&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Yet, I was so impressed with the products and support from SPARIN that I feel compelled to provide them with some positive feedback.
First of all, the SPARIN Screen Protectors are everything they advertise them to be. They work well. They protect the investment you have in your expensive hand-held electronics and they have no adverse effects upon the operation of these devices or their accessories. In some ways they actually improve the functionality (i.e. they help to reduce glare). These Screen Protectors allow the displays to remain scratch free and easy to clean.
I have installed several of these on phones and one on a smaller tablet. Using the instructions included in the package along with those found on YouTube all of my earlier installations were flawless. However, the larger the device the more challenging the installation can become.
I recommend that you review all of the SPARIN YouTube videos before you begin the process. One of the videos demonstrates an alternate installation that does not use the provided Guide Stickers. You may find it easier to maintain accurate alignment of larger Screen Protectors using that method. Also make sure you are in an absolutely dust free environment prior to performing the install.
I did encounter some difficulties getting things to work correctly when I installed a Screen Protector on my larger iPad 9.7"" (2017). It developed a persistent bubble adjacent to the “Home” button that I could not remove. I contacted SPARIN and received the best customer support I have ever witnessed. The SPARIN Customer Service Team personally responded to my email questions within hours. They were responsive, supportive and extremely helpful throughout the entire resolution process.
SPARIN has a quality product and provides outstanding customer support if you come upon a problem. This is what you expect when you make a purchase. It is too bad that other companies don’t follow SPARIN’s lead and make sure their customers get what they paid for.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_25?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=25&reviewerType=all_reviews"

We bought and applied this glass so we could use our ipad without tiny glass from the original screen cutting us or possible spills/skin oils getting inside it.

The steps weren't hard to follow - my only concern was that it was a bit difficult to get some of the bubbles out at the end, I thought maybe they were there for good. The little piece of plastic they give you to get rid of bubbles is a bit flimsy, so I used my credit card inside the screen cleaner fabric and it worked great. I bought this specifically because the iPad screen gets SO fingerprinty and it was too difficult to clean, and this has worked perfectly. I spent a good 5 minutes after installation wiping my hands all over it and ogling at how pretty it is. Even when smudges show up they're so easy to wipe off. I'm super happy with it!","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_39?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=39&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Not a problem, it's very well packaged in a super stiff cardboard book.
- I love that it came with a complete kit of stuff to make the application easy (instructions (you would be amazed how many don't ship with them, application wet cleaning cloth, application dry cleaning cloth, a dust lifter (in case there are small particles during application), guide stickers (so that it helps you ""hinge"" the glass for application (and trust me, use all 3 for the pro - better to be safe than sorry), and a regular cleaning cloth for you to use to wipe of finger prints and such.
- Application was a breeze! I waited until I got the screen protector before I even opened up iPad box. So no finger prints, virtually no dust particles.
- I followed the hinge, peel, and press from the center out method and got a flawless application without any junk under the glass.

- I COULDN'T BE ANY HAPPIER!!

*just a side note for those that it matters to - there is only one (1) hole in the protector and that's for the home button. There is no hole for the forward facing camera, but quite honestly, there doesn't need to be. it works even better, because there is one less hole for dust to collect in.","5.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_26?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=26&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Borelli","Already cracked after two weeks","September 12, 2017","Thought this would be a great protector from all the reviews. Apparently I did not get the same experience as most others. I have only had this protector on for two weeks. The instructions and materials that were included were great and I was able to install it without having any air bubbles or dust particles behind it. This is the only reason why I am giving it two stars instead of one. I have not dropped my iPad nor mishandled it in any way. I have actually barely used the iPad since I received it. Not sure what I might have did to cause the crack. The crack goes across the entire width of the screen.","2.0 out of 5 stars","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Screen-Protector-SPARIN-Tempered-Glass/product-reviews/B013JZCAZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_12?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=12&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Can’t beat the price, extremely easy to put on and the screen looks great with it on. I would give it 5 stars, but my last one cracked so I had to replace it. I had it on for 10-12 months so it had a good run. I’m also not sure if it was something I did (ie accidentally stepping on it or rolling over on it) that caused the cracks so I don’t want to blame the product if it was user error.
